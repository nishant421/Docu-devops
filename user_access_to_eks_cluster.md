### Granting Explicit Access to an IAM User for Amazon EKS Cluster Management

#### Step 1: Sign In to the AWS Management Console

1. **Open the AWS Management Console:**
   - Go to [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/).
   - Sign in with your AWS account credentials.

#### Step 2: Navigate to the Amazon EKS Service

#### Step 3: Select Your EKS Cluster

1. **Choose Your Cluster:**
   - In the Amazon EKS dashboard, select the EKS cluster you want to manage from the list of clusters.

#### Step 4: Grant Access to the IAM User

1. **Go to the Access Tab:**
   - In the EKS cluster details page, click on the "Access" tab.

2. **Add IAM User to Access Entries:**
   - Click "Create Access Entry."
   - In the "IAM principal ARN" dialog, type the ARN of the IAM user you created. For example, `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/your-iam-username`.
   - Click "Next" to save the changes.
   - In the Access Policies section, add relevant policies. Eg. AmazonEKSClusterAdminPolicy.

#### Step 5: Verify Access Configuration

1. **Install and Configure kubectl:**
   - Ensure you have `kubectl` installed and configured. Follow instructions here: [Installing kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html).

2. **Update kubeconfig File:**
   - Use the AWS CLI to update your kubeconfig file to use the IAM user credentials:
     ```sh
     aws eks update-kubeconfig --region <region> --name <cluster_name>
     ```
   - Replace `<region>` with the region where your EKS cluster is located and `<cluster_name>` with the name of your EKS cluster.

3. **Test the Configuration:**
   - Run a test command to verify access:
     ```sh
     kubectl get svc
     ```
   - If the command executes successfully and returns the list of services in your cluster, the configuration is correct.
